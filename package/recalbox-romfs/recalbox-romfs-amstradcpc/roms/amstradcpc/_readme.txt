Put your amstrad cpc roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".dsk/.kcr/.zip" extension.

Each .zip file must contain only one compressed rom.


To enable your gamepad support, go in retroarch menu with "Hotkey+B", then switch this option :
"Quick Menu/Core Input Options/User 1 Device type : Retropad" with "Amstrad Joystick"
