## RECALBOX - SYSTEM ZX81 ##

Put your zx 81 roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".tzx/.p/.zip/.7z" extension.

This system allows to use compressed roms on .zip/.7z.
But, it is only an archive. Files inside the .zip/.7z must match with extensions mentioned above.
Each .zip/.7z file must contain only one compressed rom.


To enable your gamepad support, go in retroarch menu with "Hotkey+B", then switch this option :
"Settings/Input/Input User 1 Binds/User 1 Device type : Retropad" with "Cursor Joystick"
