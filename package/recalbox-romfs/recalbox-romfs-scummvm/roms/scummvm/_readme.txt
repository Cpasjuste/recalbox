## RECALBOX - SYSTEM SCUMMVM ##

Put your scummvm game folders here.

For each game, you must create a file named from the short name of the game and with the extension .scummvm
If you want you can start ScummVM game by selecting directory if its extension is .scummvm.
You still needs to have a file named from the short name of the game and with the extension .scummvm inside this folder.
But Emulationstation will only display your `folder.scummvm` as a game.

Example:
scummvm
|- Day of the Tentacle.scummvm
| |- tentacle.scummvm
| |- ...

Short game names can be found at http://scummvm.org/compatibility/
