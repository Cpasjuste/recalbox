## RECALBOX - SYSTEM SATURN ##

Put your Sega Saturn roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".cue/.toc/.m3u/.ccd/.chd/.iso/.mds/.zip/.7z" extension.
.bin files need a .cue file to be started.

mednafen_saturn doesn't support .mds files.

This system allows to use compressed roms on .zip/.7z.
But, it is only an archive. Files inside the .zip/.7z must match with extensions mentioned above.
Each .zip/.7z file must contain only one compressed rom.
