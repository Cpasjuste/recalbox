## RECALBOX - DAPHNE ##

Put your Daphne games in this directory.

Each game must be placed in a directory having the ".daphne" extension.
This directory represents the image of the LaserDisc to execute and must contain at least m2v, ogg and txt files.

For example :
dle21.daphne/
dle21.daphne/dle21.txt
dle21.daphne/dle21.m2v
dle21.daphne/dle21.ogg

The ROM file corresponding to the game must be in the roms sub-directory under the daphne directory.

Example:
roms/dle21.zip
