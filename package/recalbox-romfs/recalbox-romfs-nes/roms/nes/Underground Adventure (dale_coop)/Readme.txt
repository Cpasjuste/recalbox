Infos
-------

NES homebrew game, made during the NESmaker Byte-Off 2019 (organized by The New 8bit Heroes).
Basically, it's a classic arcade-ish game, 1 screen levels, gems to collect in a certain amount of time, monsters to avoid (or shoot if you collect the right item) and a 2 player co-op mode.
