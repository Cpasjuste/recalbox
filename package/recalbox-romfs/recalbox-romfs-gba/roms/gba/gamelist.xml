First game of "Uranus" serie from ZoneGN. This is a vertical scrolling space shooter. Very good from what I've played (using VisualBoyAdvance), with good graphics, music, and the action was pretty fierce as well.

Waimanu for Gameboy Advance - Planet Earth is threatened by Wekas, evil alien Jellies who invaded the planet with the intent of colonizing it. Daring Waimanu will face them to defend the fate of our planet!

Waimanu can push blocks and make them slide, and sliding blocks can squash Wekas between them. He can also destroy blocks that can't be moved because they're against a wall or if there's another block behind them. Also Wekas can destroy blocks whenever they want to try to reach our hero.
