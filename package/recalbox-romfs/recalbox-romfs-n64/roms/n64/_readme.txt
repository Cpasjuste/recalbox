## RECALBOX - SYSTEM N64 ##

Put your nintendo 64 roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".n64/.v64/.z64/.zip/.7z" extension.

Only libretro cores allow to use compressed roms on .zip/.7z.
But, it is only an archive. Files inside the .zip/.7z must match with extensions mentioned above.
Each .zip/.7z file must contain only one compressed rom.

If you have problems about black screen with return to Emulationstation, please read wiki below :
