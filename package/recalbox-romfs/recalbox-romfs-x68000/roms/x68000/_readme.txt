## RECALBOX - SYSTEM SHARP X68000 ##

Put your sharp x68000 roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".dim/.img/.d88/.88d/.hdm/.dup/.2hd/.xdf/.hdf/.cmd/.m3u/.zip/.7z" extension.

This system allows to use compressed roms on .zip/.7z.
But, it is only an archive. Files inside the .zip/.7z must match with extensions mentioned above.
Each .zip/.7z file must contain only one compressed rom.
